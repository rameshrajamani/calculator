# calculator

The provided code snippet is part of a Java class named `Calculator`, which extends the `JFrame` class from the Swing library. This indicates that the class is designed to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for a calculator application. By extending `JFrame`, the `Calculator` class inherits all the functionality needed to create and manage a window in a desktop application.

The `import` statements at the top bring in necessary classes from the `java.awt` and `java.awt.event` packages, which are used for GUI components and event handling, respectively. Additionally, the `java.util.Arrays` import suggests that array-related operations might be used elsewhere in the class.

The class defines a private field, `display`, which is a `JTextField`. This component will likely serve as the calculator's display, where users can see the input and results of their calculations. The `final` keyword ensures that the reference to this `JTextField` cannot be reassigned after initialization.

A static constant, `N8N_WEBHOOK_URL`, is also defined. This string holds a URL, which appears to be a webhook endpoint. While its purpose is not clear from the snippet, it might be used for sending or receiving data related to the calculator's operations, possibly for logging or integration with external services.

The constructor `Calculator()` initializes the GUI. It sets the title of the window to "Scientific Calculator" and specifies that the application should exit when the window is closed. The `setSize(800, 600)` method defines the dimensions of the window, while `setLocationRelativeTo(null)` centers the window on the screen. Finally, `setLayout(new BorderLayout(10, 10))` sets the layout manager for the frame, using a `BorderLayout` with horizontal and vertical gaps of 10 pixels between components. This layout manager divides the window into five regions (north, south, east, west, and center), which will likely be used to organize the calculator's components.
